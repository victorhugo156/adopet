## Project Description

<p align="justify">
 Adopet is an application that has been created as a project for the Course Cross Platforma from AIT, Academy of Interactive Technology, that aim to stablish reliable connections between pets, people that wishes to adoptone and all organizations that works with animal cares and rescuing them from the abandons.

The application provides a space where pets, in poor living condition or pets that does not have a home can be listed in order to find someone to adopt them.

Adopet works as a social platform where the user will have to fill up a form with your personal information to gain access to the platform. As soon as the user got access, it will be able to see an Adoption Feed listing all the pets available for adoption with their information such as, behaviours, breed, where you can find them and the contact for adoption. 

If the user wishes to obtain more information about any pet, they can click on the pet name, it will open up the pet profile where the user will be able to get more information, see some pictures and send an email to the person in charge of the pet.
